# MACHINE-LEARNING
## Machine learning is the study of computer algorithms that improves automatically through experince.
### 2.Machines can do high frequency repetitive tasks with high accuracy without getting bored within the given time
#### Applications of machine learning
##### 1.Amazon recommending you the products based on previous history
###### 2.Face recognization in smart phones
####### Explanation for face recognization in smart phones
 1.Machine will recognize face by using numbers, whenever we set our face to recognise it will take some of the parameters such as height of the face, breadth of the face, and some other parameters.Next time when ever we ask the model to recgonise the face,if the given parameters such as height and width are satisfied then only it will recognise our face
 2.In this example we are training the model to recognize face when the parameters are satisfied, if not it will tell me not recognised.

# 2ND TASK ON APPLICATIONS OF ML,DL AND AI
##  Artificial intelligence: Artificial Intelligence is simply the ability of a computer to exhibit “intelligence”. This intelligence can either mimic human intelligence or observe real world problems and intelligently find solutions for it.Ai is the advance of machine learning
  1.AI in autonoums vehicles: Just like humans,self driving cars need to have sensors to understand the world around them and a brain to collect, perform and choose specific actions based on information gathered. For example when the fuel is low it will direct car to petrol station.Adjust the trips based on the traffic.etc.
   2. AI in businness, education, robotics etc.

# Deep Learning: Deep Learning means neural networks with a large number of hidden layers. It is an attempt to replicate the functioning of a human brain.It is like a black box, i.e. where the input and output can be seen and are known
## Applications of Dl: 
1.Google search can be taken taken as an application of DL, where we will give input and outpu will be displayed
2.Virtual assistants
3.Language translation 

# Applications of machine learning
1.Smartphones detecting faces while taking photos or unlocking themselves
2.Facebook, LinkedIn or any other social media site recommending your friends and ads you might be interested in
3.Amazon recommending you the products based on your browsing history
4.Banks using Machine Learning to detect Fraud transactions in real-time
