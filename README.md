###### 2.Face recognization in smart phones
####### Explanation for face recognization in smart phones
######## Machine will recognize face by using numbers, whenever we set our face to recognise it will take some of the parameters such as height of the face, breadth of the face, and some other parameters.Next time when ever we ask the model to recgonise the face,if the given parameters such as height and width are satisfied then only it will recognise our face
######### In this example we are training the model to recognize face when the parameters are satisfied, if not it will tell me not recognised.
